# Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction (R & Python)

This project is part of a **D√ºzce University master's course** on **Data Mining**. It aims to replicate the methodology of the following research paper:

**Machine learning for risk stratification of thyroid cancer patients: a 15-year cohort study**  
*European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2024) 281:2095‚Äì2104*

### üîç Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict thyroid cancer recurrence using machine learning.
- **Dataset:** [Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence - UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/915/differentiated+thyroid+cancer+recurrence)  
- **Implementation:** The same methodology was applied using both **Python** and **R** for comparison.
- **Analysis:** Results from both implementations are compared to understand why the same algorithms yield different outcomes.


### üìå Repositories
- **Python Implementation:** [Thyroid Recurrence (Python)]([https://github.com/your-python-repo-link](https://github.com/kerem-alba/tyroid_ml_project))
